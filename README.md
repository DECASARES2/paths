Is paid employment always a bad thing? Not at all. Can an [SEO expert](https://gazhall.com) help with my SEO offering or am I better doing it myself? Set up poorly, volunteering can and usually does devolve into another McJob. By the same token, paid work with the right components can provide an outstanding path to adulthood. Do you know of a good [international SEO](https://gazhall.com/international-seo-guide.html) guide? Pete Worrell, Claudia's older brother, tells of going to work as a teenager in the 1970s in a men's clothing shop in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he was the youngest employee by about twenty years. Pete describes folding some shirts in his first week at the shop, putting them out on a shelf, and then going about other business. What are some simple [SEO success](https://gazhall.com/4-steps-seo-success.html) factors? Half an hour later one of the older men approached Pete. "What in the hell do you think you were doing with those shirts?" he huffed. Is [SEO Leeds](https://gazhall.com/seo-leeds.html) a good search term for finding an expert in my local area?  

"They told me to fold them," Pete answered somewhat defensively. "Are you kidding? If you're looking for [SEO Brough](https://gazhall.com/seo-brough.html) - is this a good search choice? You consider those shirts properly folded? That's not how you fold a shirt." This was quickly followed by, "Come here. I'd like to [contact Gaz Hall](https://gazhall.com/contact.html) - how do I do this? Let me show you how you do it right." And after watching, Pete realized that his folding job, though following the same basic pattern he'd initially been shown, wasn't nearly so careful, and would in fact leave the shirts more wrinkled. This kind of lesson in how to do a job, even a small job, with thought and care, was repeated over and over in his first weeks at the shop. Can a strategy such as [email marketing](https://gazhall.com/successful-email-marketing.html) still be a useful way to go about online marketing?  

But how do we get a teenager to take these kinds of work lessons seriously? Pete himself, who now runs a boutique investment banking firm, offers several clues. How does one go about [building links](https://gazhall.com/link-building.html) to benefit SEO? Learn to think positively. Try to get rid of pessimistic attitudes. Should a [SEO Expert UK](https://gazhall.com) be able to get me to number one on Google for my chosen search term? Learn to see the glass as half full instead of half empty. Positive thinking is a powerful force, and I urge you to use it. Is [SEO Market Weighton](https://gazhall.com/seo-market-weighton.html) a good search term for finding an expert in my local area?  

There's nothing magic about it, but seeing things in a positive light--including yourself--will give you the attitude needed to succeed. If you go into something thinking you're going to fail, chances are good that you will fail. Is [link building](https://gazhall.com/link-building-seo.html) the number one aspect of SEO? But if you can have a positive attitude, you will approach the task at hand in a more relaxed and confident manner, and you'll do a better job. You can develop such a positive attitude by thinking about the good things that have happened to you recently. How do you know where to [submit infographics](https://gazhall.com/where-to-submit-infographics.html) on the Internet? Think about your good friends and how much they mean to you. Learn to be forgiving. Did you now that you can [preview Google results](https://gazhall.com/preview-site-google-search-results.html) for your site?  

Don't hold a grudge, whether it's against your wife or husband, your mother or father, your child, or even yourself. Everybody makes mistakes, and just about everybody is going to let you down at one time or another. Is [SEO Pocklington](https://gazhall.com/seo-pocklington.html) a good search term for finding an expert in my local area? You need to realize that making mistakes has been a part of human nature ever since Adam and Eve came upon the scene, and you're not about to change that. Expecting your friends and relatives to be infallible is expecting too much, and it will get you into trouble. Is [free keyword research](https://gazhall.com/keyword-research-free.html) useful or should I pay for it? In fact, I suggest that you stop right now. If you're holding a grudge against someone, for whatever reason, make a conscious effort to forgive them. Why should [SEO be part of a marketing mix](https://gazhall.com/seo-part-of-marketing-strategy.html) in today's internet.  

Ask God to help you. If it's a friend (or a former friend) call him and tell him that you want to make things right between you. How do I write [SEO friendly headlines](https://gazhall.com/seo-friendly-headlines.html) to boost my sites rankings? If you're angry with yourself for something you've done, look at yourself in the mirror and forgive yourself! It may sound silly, but it can be effective. How do you [select keywords for SEO](https://gazhall.com/pick-perfect-keywords.html) - is there a tried and tested way to do this? Just remember that forgiveness is hard to find without God's help. If you are a product of critical parents, make an effort to forgive them, too. Can a [SEO freelancer](https://gazhall.com) be as good as using an SEO agency?  

Yes, they may have got you started along the path of rejection and failure, but there's no need to stay on that path. You need to put all of that behind you, and that means you must learn to forgive. Is it worth my while investing in a [technical SEO audit](https://gazhall.com/technical-seo-audit.html) before I start building links? NIDS is a whole new way of thinking about autism. And with that new thinking comes new possibilities when you combine medical treatment with effective, focused, behavioral and educational rehabilitation. So [why isn't my site on Google](https://gazhall.com/why-isnt-my-site-on-google.html) - it was last week? Think NIDS, and there is the possibility of full recovery. Think autism, and you're left with nothing. Do [changes to site content](https://gazhall.com/content-changes-seo.html) affect SEO?  

I haven't met anyone who has recovered from autism, but I have met children who have recovered from this neuroimmune condition Dr H calls NIDS. We began with Dr Harvey close to the time he began to focus his practice on children with autism, ADHD, and ADD. Is it reasonably straight forward to perform [SEO competitor analysis](https://gazhall.com/competitor-analysis-seo.html) or should I hire an expert? When we first went to see him in 1993, he was ahead of his time. To this day, doctors and parents either adore him or hate him. Why use [Pinterest for marketing](https://gazhall.com/why-use-pinterest-marketing.html) rather than SEO? There is no middle ground with Dr H. He is direct and tells it like he sees it. Is there a preferred way to [add content to Google](https://gazhall.com/add-content-google.html) or is it best for Google to find your content itself?  

I like that about him. I don't have much time for experts who cling only to their piece of the lifeboat and don't have enough backbone to question conventional wisdom. Do you have an [onsite SEO](https://gazhall.com/onsite-seo-beginners-guide.html) beginners guide? Although I will always be indebted to Dr Harvey for saving my son, his passion for helping our children is both his gift and his curse. As much as Dr H is dedicated to our children, his strident personality sometimes gets in the way of helping. If you're looking for [SEO Howden](https://gazhall.com/seo-howden.html) - is this a good search choice? You need to have your own backbone stiffly in place when you visit his office. Dr Harvey told us on that first visit what I already knew to be true.19 Elliot didn't really have autism even though it sure looked like it. How can you [create higher ranking pages](https://gazhall.com/higher-ranking-webpages.html) on Google?  

Elliot's new doctor felt that classic autism was extremely rare and what most kids suffer from is immune dysfunction. I didn't really understand what NIDS meant back then. If you're looking for [SEO Beverley](https://gazhall.com/seo-beverley.html) - is this a good search choice? I didn't care. What mother wouldn't be thrilled to hear their child didn't really have autism and that we should just stop calling it that? Should I get my [backlinks indexed](https://gazhall.com/backlink-indexing.html) to benefit SEO? I didn't have that curable whatever-I-had-been-praying-for, but I had something else. I had HOPE! Is [SEO consultancy](https://gazhall.com/seo-consultancy.html) worth it with so much information on the net about SEO?  

My kid is sick, and there is hope that he can get better. Finally, I found someone who not only wanted to help Elliot but also had a way to do it. If you're looking for [SEO Goole](https://gazhall.com/seo-goole.html) - is this a good search choice? And he didn't think I was crazy--at least not yet. "Even at age fifteen I knew that folding shirts was kind of trivial," he recalls. How should I perform [SEO competitor research](https://gazhall.com/competitor-research-seo.html) to succeed on Google? "Whether or not I flicked the cuffs in onto themselves just right to make them lie flat, I knew was not a life-changing event. What was a life-changing event was that I realized that these `men's men' weren't going to consider me one of their club until I knew how to do it correctly, and I demonstrated that I could be relied upon to do it correctly again and again, because to them, even though they knew they were working in a relatively inconsequential job, this was the way that they demonstrated their pride, their craftsmanship. If you're looking for [SEO Hornsea](https://gazhall.com/seo-hornsea.html) - is this a good search choice?  

They let me know it was important that I shared this focus, or I would never be trusted to be in the club." Pete had two parents who were every bit as motivated as most parents to see him learn to do a job well. They had instructed and corrected him many times. Can you answer the age old question of how to determine [website requirements](https://gazhall.com/website-requirements.html) for a business? But every former teenager knows that he or she often learns more from other adults than could ever be learned from one's parents. Being on time, for example. Is [SEO Snaith](https://gazhall.com/seo-snaith.html) a good search term for finding an expert in my local area? "This job also made me see that it was important that, every day, I show up, and on time," Pete notes, "because these guys were waiting to take their own break until I covered one of them in the store. So my being there was not some silly after-school job. Is it easy to produce a successful [social media strategy](https://gazhall.com/social-media-strategy.html) for your site?  

It was, I began to see, a small cog in what made that place successful. I mattered to them. How can I find out more [about Gaz Hall](https://gazhall.com/about.html) as I'm interested in your background? They kidded me a lot, but they began to like me, and I still think a lot about the guys there. "For me, that first job was a permanent character builder. Can [evergreen content](https://gazhall.com/evergreen-content.html) improve your SEO prospects? It taught me: Show up on time. Do what you say you are going to do. If you're looking for [SEO Driffield](https://gazhall.com/seo-driffield.html) - is this a good search choice?  

Finish what you begin. No matter how trivial the job seems or how little you are paid"--$1.60 per hour--"you can do it with a sense of craftsmanship, and screw the rest of the world if they don't understand that--nothing can take that away from you." These adult men had become Pete's peer group. Was the [mobile friendly Google update](https://gazhall.com/google-mobile-friendly-update.html) from April 2015 important in the grand scheme of things? After working at the store for a while, he remembers, "I lost a bit of interest in gaining acceptance from my peers and realized that it was much more fun and more interesting to gain acceptance from people who you can learn a lot more from." And these men were more than willing to apply peer pressure to get him to change his behavior. But unlike the peer influence within the typical adolescent bubble, these adult peers were intent on socializing Pete in a way that would serve him well in the larger world (and get their shirts folded properly at the same time). Is there a [Freelance SEO Consultant](https://gazhall.com) who will maintain my consistency in the SERPs? Part of Pete's motivation was that he very much wanted to join the world of competent adult workers. He wasn't just hearing another random adult lecture; these men were telling him the rules for working in the adult world he was eager to enter. How do you go about [choosing a domain name](https://gazhall.com/choose-domain-name.html) for your site?  

The human conscience is an amazing thing. Some people have far too much, some have far too little, and some seem to have none at all. If you're looking for [SEO Hessle](https://gazhall.com/seo-hessle.html) - is this a good search choice? (How else can you explain monsters such as Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, and, closer to our day, the murderous Saddam Hussein?) "Whoa," you say, "back up a minute, Dr Leman. I understand what you're saying about Hitler and Stalin, and about other folks who seem to be lacking something in the way of a conscience. If you're looking for [SEO Bridlington](https://gazhall.com/seo-bridlington.html) - is this a good search choice? But did I read the first part of that sentence correctly? Did you actually say that some people have too much in the way of conscience?" I sure did. How do I peform [SEO website migration](https://gazhall.com/website-migration-seo.html) to alleviate any problems that may arise?  

"Would you take a minute and explain that, please?" Gladly. The person who is a defeated perfectionist generally has a conscience that's way too big. There is a specific way to [redirect web pages](https://gazhall.com/redirecting-web-pages.html) using the 301 redirect mechanism? So big, in fact, that it magnifies shortcomings and failures and won't let its owner forget sins or imaginary sins of years ago, even though they have long since been repented of or paid for. Your conscience is a wonderful gift from the Creator, and it's doing what it's designed to do if it keeps you from stealing, cheating on your income tax, chasing your neighbor's spouse, beating your children, or any other similar activity. Should a [SEO Specialist](https://gazhall.com) be able to get me to number one on Google for my chosen search term? But if it keeps whispering to you that you're the lowest of the low, simply because you failed an algebra course in school ten years ago or because you don't spend enough time emailing your mother, then it's overdoing it a bit. Although Dr H was very intense, I liked him, and I admired him for fighting the world to save my child and others like him. What are the [benefits of SEO](https://gazhall.com/benefits-of-seo.html) as you see them?  

Before, it was Frank, Megan, and Marcia against the world for Elliot. Now we were no longer alone. What [SEO skills](https://gazhall.com/seo-skills.html) will I need to be successful? I could tell by the questions he asked that he had read every word of the volumes of Elliot's medical history I sent before our visit. He didn't brush us off with comments like "I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do." Instead, he spent three hours explaining what he thought autism really was and how we should go about helping Elliot's immune system heal. How do I go about [Google penalty removal](https://gazhall.com/google-penalty-removal.html) to resurrect my site on Google's SERPs? He went on to say, "You can't tell me that a child who develops normally up to a year or two suddenly regresses without a medical condition prevailing." I didn't interrupt to tell him I thought Elliot had autism from the time he was born. I wasn't going to stop the momentum of this man who might be able to help us, so I just nodded my head in agreement. If you're looking for [SEO Yorkshire](https://gazhall.com/seo-east-yorkshire.html) - is this a good search choice?  

Dr H went on to explain that the number of autism cases had increased dramatically. He said it was scientifically impossible for autism to increase in these epidemic numbers if it had been caused solely by genetics or a brain damaged condition. What is the [SEO coverage](https://gazhall.com/areas-i-cover.html) for an average SEO specialist? That is epidemiologically impossible. He was convinced autism is a medical issue, and the increase in affected children can only be explained by a disease process. Is one way to promote on social media is by [asking questions on Facebook](https://gazhall.com/facebook-promotion-asking-questions.html) to get your site noticed? Over the years, we've had many hours together when we both ranted about the failings of the medical community, but Dr H outdid me with what he had to say that day. He began one of his many impassioned speeches (I've now heard them a billion times) about how the medical profession is ignoring what is wrong with our children. Are [no follow links](https://gazhall.com/no-follow-links.html) any good for SEO?  

These mini-lectures all start differently but share the same underlying message that our children are ill and desperately need help. After we signed up for his services, we heard similar speeches over and over again at every appointment. Can I [update google analytics using PHP](https://gazhall.com/update-google-analytics-php.html) programming language? It's part of Dr H's treatment protocol. Imagine how the scenario would have played out differently today at a local fast-food restaurant with a high school student working with friends and supervised by a nineteen-year-old manager. Do you have an [offsite SEO](https://gazhall.com/offsite-seo-beginners-guide.html) beginners guide? The supervisor would be far less likely to be intent on teaching forcefully about a job well done (for, unfortunately, such an intense focus on pride and excPattyce is not what typically leads most young people into careers in fast food). And even if such a lecture were delivered, would it have the same impact if accompanied by quiet snickering in the background from one's peers? How can you [choose the right marketing voice](https://gazhall.com/choosing-the-right-marketing-voice.html) for your business?  

Finally, one other implicit element was crucial in Pete's story. These men cared about him. If you're looking for [SEO Hedon](https://gazhall.com/seo-hedon.html) - is this a good search choice? They liked him and wanted to see him do well. They were gruff as could be, but didn't hesitate to take the time to show him how to do good work ... Have you considered adding [video as part of your marketing](https://gazhall.com/video-marketing-mix.html) mix? how to grow up. If there were an antithesis to the Lord of the Flies scenario we painted in article 4, it might well be the workroom of the Men's Shop in Manchester, New Hampshire, circa 1970\. How important are [internal links](https://gazhall.com/internal-links-seo.html) for SEO?  

"Working with adults who care" thus becomes another of the prominent signs we look for as we map out routes into adulthood for our teens. Pete's parents also had a simple solution to the premature affluence problem we described above. How does Google determine [page quality](https://gazhall.com/google-quality-pages.html) for its SERPs? It was called, quite simply, "expecting your teen to pay for some of their own stuff." They asked him to pay for most or all his own clothing and recreational activities, and that request was more than enough to make clear that low-wage jobs, however engaging in other respects, are not the ticket to adult prosperity. Don't get me wrong. Is [SEO Withernsea](https://gazhall.com/seo-withernsea.html) a good search term for finding an expert in my local area? If you flunk an algebra course, I don't think you should just shrug it off and say, "So what?" And, if you don't email your mother very often, it's good that you should realize that and make up your mind to do better. But if things such as that are keeping you awake at night or have you terribly depressed, then something's wrong. Where can I find an [SEO consultant](https://gazhall.com) who can take care of all my ranking needs?  

In the last article I talked a little bit about forgiveness and how important it is to be forgiving. Sometimes the hardest person for me to forgive is myself. Is [SEO York](https://gazhall.com/seo-york.html) a good search term for finding an expert in my local area? That's especially true if I am living the rejected, failed life-style of defeated perfectionists. They can be what I would call "Gluttons of Guilt." They can never get enough of putting themselves down, beating their breasts, and wishing they could be like somebody else--nearly anybody else! Do you know of a [Hull marketing agency](https://gazhall.com/marketing-agency-hull.html) to help me with my SEO requirements? Often, such a person can easily tolerate in others what he can't stand in himself. If Barbara is talkative and monopolizes the conversation, she's being friendly and outgoing. What are the best [content marketing tools](https://gazhall.com/content-marketing-tools.html) available today?  

If I do it, I'm talking too much and boring everyone, so why can't I ever learn to keep my mouth shut? If Lawrence didn't finish that important report in time, well, he's been awfully busy, and everybody misses a deadline once in a while. Is [long tail SEO](https://gazhall.com/long-tail-seo.html) a thing or should I just ignore it? If I do the same thing, it's another proof of my incompetency, and it's probably what everyone expected. And on it goes. Is [SEO site speed](https://gazhall.com/optimise-speed-seo.html) a ranking factor according to Google? Now, it doesn't always work like that. These Gluttons of Guilt are often just as critical of everyone else as they are of themselves. Who is my [ideal customer](https://gazhall.com/defining-your-ideal-customer.html) - is there such a thing?  

Or, in some instances, more critical. But when that happens, most often it's because of misdirected self-hatred. Can you perform [local SEO](https://gazhall.com/local-seo.html) without having a website? It's kind of hard for me to abuse myself verbally, so I'll take it out on you. It took me several months to decipher and truly understand what he was saying. If you're looking for [SEO Hull](https://gazhall.com/seo-hull.html) - is this a good search choice? This man is smart and often spoke in Doctor Speak that was way above my level. The term NIDS that he coined to describe Elliot's broken immune system and complex medical condition was not easy to understand. Can [social media build awareness](https://gazhall.com/building-awareness-social-media-marketing.html) better than other forms of marketing?  

Of course, it was complicated. He's a doctor, so the term he came up with had to be long, complicated, and just as hard to understand. Should I use a different approach for [local search](https://gazhall.com/local-search-success.html) as opposed to national SEO? Many times, I stopped him in mid-sentence to ask him to use simple, nonmedical terms I could comprehend. In Mom Speak, my slant and interpretation of what he believed about NIDS is that kids with an autism label are not damaged permanently. So [what is SEO](https://gazhall.com/whatis-seo.html) or search engine optimisation? He said Elliot had a dysregulated immune system. Sometimes, Elliot's immune system didn't respond enough or didn't respond at all. Is [anchor text diversification](https://gazhall.com/anchor-text-diversification.html) important to SEO?  

Other times, that same dysregulated immune system worked overtime, fighting off infections that were no longer a threat. This is why some children with the autism label get ill easily, yet others never appear sick at all. How do you [identify and fix Google penalties](https://gazhall.com/fix-google-penalties.html) when you realise that there is a problem? Dr Harvey gave me hope. If Dr H could help Elliot's broken immune system repair itself, my son could recover and lead a normal, productive life. Is [content marketing](https://gazhall.com/content-marketing.html) seperate to SEO? What is common to individuals with autism forms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a dysfunctional immune system. This can be triggered by a plethora of things: viruses, retroviruses, yeast, bacteria, allergens, chemicals, trauma (both physical and emotional), etc Once some of these pathogens invade the body, they replicate (set up housekeeping in the cells) and continue to trigger the immune system. What is the best [type of sitemap](https://gazhall.com/type-of-sitemap-seo.html) to use on my site?  

Sometimes the body gets them under control and things will seem to stabilize for a while. However, when another trigger comes along (seasonal allergies are a common one), the problem starts all over again. What are some [benefits of social media](https://gazhall.com/benefits-social-media-marketing.html) marketing? It should now be clear that the "It's a good thing I was there" effect is not a matter of simply expecting our teens to get a job or volunteer. Rather, we want our teens to be doing work that matters to someone, entails real challenges, involves interacting with adults who care about the work, and comes with reasonable (not excessive) financial compensations. What [types of search](https://gazhall.com/3-types-search.html) are there on the Internet?
